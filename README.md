ascii game

some backlog todos:
[] Parallax ascii layers (kinda like height)
[] Scaling (zoom) like 4walls -> 1wall (zoom out) etc, or even 1char -> 4char (zoom in)
[] UI placing support (i.e. topleft 300x400 = camera, topright 100x400 = inventory, bottom 800x100 = log, etc)
[] UI alert windows (important log messages) - something 3x32 like = WARNING: YOU OK DUDE? =
